🌍 **From Spain · Based in Paris**  
📚 **Data Science**  
📊 **Improving policymaking by applying data science tools**  


## 🌱 About me  



I studied Political Science and later discovered how much I enjoy working with data.  
What began as a minor in Data Science soon became a way of exploring policy questions that fascinate me.  
I’m now doing a Master’s in Data and Economics for Public Policy at École Polytechnique, where I also work as a Research Assistant in the Computational Social Sciences team, focusing on LLMs for text classification.  
I’m excited to apply these skills to real-world policymaking projects — new initiatives are coming soon!
