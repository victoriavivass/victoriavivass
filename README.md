## 🌱 About me  

I studied Political Science and later discovered how much I enjoy working with data.  
What began as a minor in Data Science soon became a way of exploring the social and policy questions that fascinate me.  
I’m now doing a Master’s in Data and Economics for Public Policy at École Polytechnique, where I also work as a Research Assistant in the Computational Social Sciences team, focusing on NLP.  
I’m excited to apply these skills to real-world policymaking projects — new data initiatives with public administrations are coming soon!
